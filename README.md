Our group decided to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, & our job was cut out for us, but we got to the finish line! With our app, you'll be able to sign up, create a profile, meet and connect with individuals that fit your choices of the things you like to eat & drink.

HOPEFULLY YOU ENJOY OUR APP FOR EATING, DRINKING & SOCIALIZING.üòÅ
